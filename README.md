## Mission Statement

The Universal Collective GitHub Team is dedicated to developing innovative tools, utilities, and resources that empower our community. We focus on open-source collaboration, learning, and creating software that enhances the experience within our Discord server and beyond.


## Repositories

We maintain several repositories, each with a specific focus:

- **[Universal Collective Bot](https://github.com/Universal-Collective/Universal-Collective-Bot)**: The primary utility bot for our Discord server, packed with features to enhance server management and user engagement.
<!-- - **[Documentation and Guides](https://github.com/Universal-Collective/Documentation-Guides)**: Comprehensive documentation for our projects, including setup guides, API references, and user manuals.
- **[Community Resources](https://github.com/Universal-Collective/Community-Resources)**: A collection of resources, such as templates, tools, and assets, that support our community's needs. -->

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from all team members. Please follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository you wish to contribute to.
2. **Create a Branch**: Use descriptive names for your branches (e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`).
3. **Commit Changes**: Make small, incremental commits with clear messages. Use the format: `Add/Update/Fix [feature] - brief description`.
4. **Pull Request**: When your changes are ready, submit a pull request. Include a detailed description of your changes, and reference any relevant issues.
5. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the team. Be prepared to discuss and make revisions based on feedback.
