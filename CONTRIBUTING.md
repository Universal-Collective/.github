## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please ensure you have read and understand the following:

1. **Code of Conduct**: Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Universal-Collective/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to understand the expectations for behavior within our community.
2. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**: Review the project's README, architecture documents, and existing issues to understand its purpose, structure, and current needs.
3. **Development Environment**: Set up your local development environment by following the setup instructions in the repository’s README or `SETUP.md`.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues while using our software, please report them by following these steps:

1. **Search Existing Issues**: Check if the issue has already been reported. If it has, you can add your information or feedback to the existing issue.
2. **Open a New Issue**: If the issue is new, open an issue with a clear title and description. Include details about the environment (e.g., OS, version), steps to reproduce the issue, and any relevant logs or screenshots.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements. To propose an enhancement:

1. **Search Existing Issues/Discussions**: Ensure your idea hasn’t already been suggested.
2. **Open a New Enhancement Issue**: If your suggestion is new, open an enhancement issue with a clear title and detailed description. Explain the motivation behind the enhancement and how it would benefit users.

### Submitting Pull Requests

When you're ready to contribute code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the repository page to create a copy in your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch**: Use descriptive branch names (e.g., `feature/add-authentication`, `fix/issue-123`) to make it clear what your changes address.
3. **Make Your Changes**: Ensure your code follows our [Code Style and Standards](#code-style-and-standards).
4. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Each commit should focus on a single issue or task.
5. **Push to Your Fork**: Push the changes to your branch in your forked repository.
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Navigate to the original repository and submit a pull request. Provide a detailed description of your changes, referencing any relevant issues.

### Writing Documentation

Good documentation is crucial for our project's success. To contribute:

1. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: Look for outdated, unclear, or missing documentation.
2. **Make Your Changes**: Update or add documentation in the relevant markdown files (e.g., `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `docs/` directory).
3. **Submit a Pull Request**: Follow the same process as [Submitting Pull Requests](#submitting-pull-requests) to submit your documentation changes.

## Code Style and Standards

To maintain consistency and readability, please adhere to the following coding standards:

- **Language-Specific Guidelines**: Follow the best practices for the programming language you are working with (e.g., PEP 8 for Python, PSR-12 for PHP).
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (spaces over tabs unless specified), and ensure your code is well-commented.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Follow naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes. Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Code Review Process

All pull requests go through a code review process to maintain the quality of the codebase:

1. **Automated Checks**: When you submit a pull request, automated tools may run tests or check for code quality issues.
2. **Review by Maintainers**: A project maintainer will review your pull request, providing feedback or requesting changes if necessary.
3. **Approval and Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch. You may be asked to squash commits or make final adjustments before merging.

## Community Guidelines

- **Respect**: Treat all contributors and community members with respect. Constructive criticism is welcome, but personal attacks are not.
- **Collaboration**: Be open to collaboration. If someone offers help or feedback, consider their suggestions and engage in a positive discussion.
- **Inclusive Language**: Use inclusive language in both code and discussions.
